battle body stuff:

punch - frames 7 8 9 10 are looped until the circle effect is gone. If clicked, proceeds to punch O. if not, proceed to punch X.

death frames 6 7 8 are looped for three or four times for maximum effect.

Item - frames 7 8 9 10 are looped twice to show rummaging through the pocket.

Item D frames 3 4 5 6 are looped thrice for drinking the drink.

Item F frames 4 5 6 7 are looped thrice for chewing the food.

Theres a tiny mistake in the example of the Item T example gif. The back arm isn't supposed to jiggle like that.

Enemy Weak animation is frame 1 2 3 then 4 5 6 three times then 3 2 1 back to idle.

Enemy Equal animation is frame 1 2 3 4 5 6 then hold 7 for 6 "frames" and then frame 8 then 2 1 back to idle.

Enemy Strong animation is frame 1 2 3 then 4 5 4 5 4 5 4 5 4 5 then 3 2 1 back to idle.
